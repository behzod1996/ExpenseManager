### Expense Manager is simple, intuitive, stable and modern app that is just designed for you. Everything you need at your fingertips to manage the expenditures and budgets.

## ðŸ”¨ Technologies used:
### ðŸ¥‡ `Kotlin` 
Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language aimed to make developers happier. Itâ€™s concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.
### ðŸ§µ  `Coroutines`
A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation. It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.
### ðŸ“¦ `Room`
<br>The `Room`  persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.<br/>
### ðŸ”‘ `Android Architecture Components`
<br>Android Architecture Components (AAC) is a new collection of libraries that contains the lifecycle-aware components. It can solve problems with configuration changes, supports data persistence, reduces boilerplate code, helps to prevent memory leaks and simplifies async data loading into your UI. I canâ€™t say that it brings absolutely new approaches for solving these issues, but, finally, we have a formal, single and official direction. <br/>
