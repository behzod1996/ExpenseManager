### ðŸ’° Expense Manager is simple, intuitive, stable and modern app that is just designed for you. Everything you need at your fingertips to manage the expenditures and budgets.

## ðŸ“„ Technologies used:
### `Kotlin`
Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language aimed to make developers happier. Itâ€™s concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.
### `Coroutines`
A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation. It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.
### `Room`
The `Room`  persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors. 
  - [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
  - 
  - [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Navigation refers to the interactions that allow users to navigate across, into, and back out from the different pieces of content within your app
  - [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - Jetpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
