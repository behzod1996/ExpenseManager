### ðŸ’° Expense Manager is simple, intuitive, stable and modern app that is just designed for you. Everything you need at your fingertips to manage the expenditures and budgets.

## ðŸ“„ Technologies used:
### `Kotlin`
Kotlin is a modern but already mature programming language aimed to make developers happier. Itâ€™s concise, safe, interoperable with Java and other languages, and provides many ways to reuse code between multiple platforms for productive programming.
### `Coroutines`
A coroutine is an instance of suspendable computation. It is conceptually similar to a thread, in the sense that it takes a block of code to run that works concurrently with the rest of the code. However, a coroutine is not bound to any particular thread. It may suspend its execution in one thread and resume in another one.
### `Room`
The `Room`  persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
### `Android Architecture Components`
